                The proposal should show where the new line begins and ends, which fixtures it serves, the planned pipe material and size, and every expected access opening.

                Also confirm whether drywall patching, texture, paint, insulation replacement, permits, and fixture reconnection are included. These details often determine the complete project cost more than the pipe alone.
