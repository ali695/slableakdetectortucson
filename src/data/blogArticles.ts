      { question: "Can cost be quoted from symptoms alone?", answer: "A broad discussion is possible, but a reliable project estimate needs diagnosis, access review, pipe route, and restoration scope." },
      { question: "Is rerouting cheaper than direct repair?", answer: "Sometimes. The answer depends on route complexity and the cost of floor and concrete restoration." },
      { question: "Does emergency service cost more?", answer: "After-hours response, travel, extraction, temporary work, and scheduling may add cost. Ask what the emergency visit includes." },
      { question: "Should I choose the lowest quote?", answer: "Compare equivalent scope, evidence, materials, testing, restoration, permits, warranty, and contingencies—not only the total." }

For direct access, ask for the expected opening and field-condition limits." ] },

    faqs: [
      { question: "Should detection fees be separate?", answer: "They may be separate or credited, but the arrangement should be clear and should not make the diagnosis less independent." },
      { question: "Should warranty terms be written?", answer: "Yes. Identify duration, covered workmanship or materials, exclusions, transfer terms, and the claim process." },
      { question: "What is a change order?", answer: "It documents additional or revised work, price, and schedule after conditions differ from the original scope." },
      { question: "Should cleanup be included?", answer: "The estimate should state dust-control and debris-removal responsibilities as well as any final cleaning exclusions." }
